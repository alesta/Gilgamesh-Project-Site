				<h3>Light Yagami Character Biography</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Light Yagami is first introduced as an exemplary young high school student. Ranking first in his class, as well as on national exams, he is praised by his family and teachers. However, he distances himself from many of his classmates, as he believes them to not be fit to live in a civilized society, for they have undesirable traits. However, the behavior of his classmates is only a subset of what Light views overall as societal decay. Given the high crime rates in his city, he learns of very horrendous incidents through the news each day. Powerless to make a change, he distances himself from others, resulting in him developing a very arrogant and self-centered personality. However, Light is also an idealist; although he lacks the power and influence to better society, he desires to conduct such a change. So, when he later finds a mysterious book which claims to be capable of killing those whose names are written within it, although he views it with skepticism, his curiosity and desire for power ultimately convince him to test it on a criminal: the Shinjuku Street Slasher. When he realizes the potential the note holds, he immediately sets out on a crusade to purge society of criminals, with the intention of creating a utopian society. The following series of deaths amongst the world’s most hardened criminals sends ripples throughout society; although the deaths are apparently natural, as they had all died of heart attacks, it does not take long for society to realize that these people were indeed murdered. Society dubs him “Kira”, and support for Kira begins to grow rapidly as crime rates plummet. However, Light soon loses sight of this goal when the police create a team to investigate Kira, and is then forced to kill otherwise innocent civilians in order to protect his identity. Over time, he is corrupted by this power which he wields; he begins to see himself as the god of a new world order. Between his now uninhibited desire to kill and his capability to do so, he becomes the monster that he had sought to eradicate.</p>

				<h3>Death Note Analysis</h3>
				<p>	According to Joseph Campbell’s monomyth, Light Yagami’s stage of separation would encompass the period of time between his discovery of the Death Note and the introduction of a second Kira later on. During this period of time, Light experiments with the Death Note in order to better understand its potential. Little character progression occurs during this interval; however, the viewer is introduced to the majority of the cast during this time. Additionally, Light’s initial psychology is well described during this time. For instance, it is made apparent that Light Yagami hates to lose; so much so that he will make completely irrational decisions solely to spite another who had beaten him previously. A clear example of this would be Light’s determination to kill the detective who was searching for him, L, after Kira was humiliated on public television. By the end of this phase of separation, Light’s psychology is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrogant</li>
<li>Self-Centered</li>
<li>Irrational</li>
<li>Temperamental</li>
<li>Idealistic</li>
<li>Ruthless</li>
</ul>
	</p><p>However, in stories such as The Epic of Gilgamesh, the hero of the story goes through some sort of ordeal which reshapes their psychology in such a way that allows them to achieve their goals. Whereas Gilgamesh successfully betters himself by the end of his monomyth, Light fails to do so. In fact, his psychology by the end of his story nearly mirrors that of the one he had going into his journey, albeit that he is more arrogant and slightly insane by the end. Due to his inability to change, he was inevitably defeated by his own actions; his gradual mistakes which he had made due to his irrational nature eventually allowed for his enemies to discover his identity. For instance, during the initiation of the story, L had had the suspicion that he and popular actrice Misa Amane were both Kira. Should Light had chosen to abandon his quest at this time, or perhaps just choose a different course of action, then he may have survived longer than he ultimately had. However, at the time, his primary concern was to find a way to rid himself of both L and Misa’s Shinigami, Rem, rather than to secure his own safety. He had viewed them as the two biggest threats to his new world order, so he worked relentlessly to kill them. However, in rushing to achieve this end, he had left behind clues which would eventually undeniably prove him to be Kira. In particular, he had created fake rules within his note, so that the police would be hesitant to simply destroy it once found. In the end, these rules which he created turned out to be easily testable. Once their validity was brought into question, so too was the Light Yagami, who was cleared of suspicion solely on the basis of the forged rules.
	It is apparent from the turn of events in the series that Light’s reluctance to change due to his zealotry had finally resulted in his downfall. Contrasting this with the other stories analyzed, it would appear that a general trend exists within stories which follow Campbell’s monomyth: change is necessary in order for the hero to fulfill their destiny. Death Note is a clear example of the inverse: failure on the part of the hero to go through such change results in their failure to achieve their goals. This lends itself back to Campbell’s concept of the monomyth in that it strengthens the idea that the cycle is necessary. Those heroes who rush to their goal without forethought fail, whereas heroes who take their time with each portion of their journey are rewarded in the end.</p>
