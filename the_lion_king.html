				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>The audience is shown Simba for the first time as an infant cub, in this iconic shot he is held high above the other animals to show that he is destined to one day be king. His life is perfect in that moment. The next time he is shown he has aged to a small child, still a cub, but now he clearly has a personality, he loves and respects his parents Mufasa and Sarabi, he is eager to learn everything there is to know about being king. He still has the innocence of a child, and eagerly absorbs every bit of information his father gives him, however he retains a sense of superiority about his royal status. He is fooled by his evil uncle Scar, who plots to kill Simba and his father to become king, he sends Simba to the domain of the evil hyenas who are in cahoots with Scar. He brings his friend Nala along with him for the adventure, and almost gets both of them killed. Mufasa swoops in to save them just in time but is very disappointed with Simba for disobeying him, and of course once Simba hears this he is overcome with guilt, the two make up but Simba realizes that he is not a man yet, and that he cannot do without his father. A second attempt is made on Simba’s life, but this time Mufasa ends up dead, and Scar convinces Simba that the responsibility of Mufasa’s death rests squarely on his shoulders, though Scar is in fact the murderer. Scar, taking advantage of Simba’s fear and confusion, convinces him to run away, then sends hyenas to kill him. Simba escapes the chase and runs away into the wilderness where he finds a new home. He lives in a jungle with a meerkat named Timone, and a warthog named Pumba, they teach him to leave every worry behind and live a care free life. Though he tries his best to live like this, he still mourns the loss of his father. He becomes an adult. Suddenly Simba is confronted with a ghost from his past, as Nala comes to his remote jungle in search of food. At first he is overjoyed to see Nala, however she urges him to return home and become the king he was meant to be, but he does not want to face his responsibilities. Nala and Simba fall in love. Soon Simba learns that under the reign of Scar, his homeland has been ravaged by the hyenas and that all the animals but the lions and have moved. Both lion and hyena are starving to death, yet he still refuses to come home. Out of the blue a wise old baboon named Rafiki comes to remind Simba that he is in fact his father’s son, and reminds Simaba that his father’s teachings are still with him, even while he wandered away from home. He also leads Simba to see his father’s spirit appear in the clouds. Mufasa tells Simba to remember who he is and finally convinces him to return home and fight for his homeland. Simba is devastated by the destruction Scar has wrought and quickly hatches a plan to defeat Scar. However scar quickly turns his plan around and forces Simba to tell the other lions that he killed Mufasa, this throws him off guard and forces him to defend himself, and scar almost kills Simba, but not before admitting to Simba that he is the real murderer. In a fit of rage, wherein Simba realizes that all the guilt he ever felt was really Scar’s fault, he overpowers Scar and forces Scar to confess, this launches the lions and hyenas into an enormous battle, which the lions win. Simba chooses to spare Scar’s life but Scar attacks again and ends up being eaten by the hyenas he once conspired with. Simba takes the kingship and life giving rain pours down in the wake of his victory. Mufasa’s voice once again comes down from above to tell Simba that he has succeeded using one word “remember”. Peace is restored in his home, the pride lands, thanks to Simba.</p>

				<h3>Lion King Analysis</h3>
				<p>At the end of the movie, Simba’s life falls back into order. He learns that he is not in fact responsible for his father’s death. He is reunited with his mother, and can finally face her with love, knowing that he is not the reason for her pain. He even fulfils wishes shown to him by his father from beyond the grave. He usurps his father’s murderer and saves his home from destruction and death. He also successfully leads the pride as king, and finds happiness in his personal life, by marrying the love of his life, and giving a home to his best friends, but most importantly he is the reason that the other lions do not starve, he is truly their savior. All this spells joy in Simba’s life. He gains everything he ever wanted, and some things he never knew he wanted. By overcoming his fear and returning home, he not only saves his family, he saves himself. He was lost, and in returning unselfishly to help his loved ones in need, he finds his truest true self, and at long last fills his father’s shoes, something he has been trying to do his whole life.</p>
<p>Throughout the movie, Simba changes from a spoiled little cub, to an irresponsible young adult, and then finally to a responsible mindful leader. His heroic separation comes when he is young, and his father, Mufasa, is killed. Scar, his treacherous uncle, convinces Simba that he is responsible for Mufasa’s death. Hurt and confused, Simba runs away and seeks out a care free existence, but can never truly find it, due to the guilt he feels. This guilt building inside him is what gives him the fire to want to honor his father’s memory, and even staying away from his home, he clearly wants to return, he is kept away only by his own fear. During his initiation, his father, comes down from heaven to tell Simba that he has failed in remembering him, he knows the only way he can ever truly honor his father’s memory is to go home, to face his fears and to become the hero his family needs him to be. When he arrives home, and sees the destruction brought down on the land, he is overcome by a wave of purpose and responsibility. In that moment he does not care if he is discovered to be a murderer, he does not fear what his mother might think, all he knows is that he is needed.  In that moment, he remembers what his father taught him, and forgets the brazen thoughts he had about bravery as a child, in that moment he becomes truly brave.</p>
<p>Once he confronts his uncle, the truth gets turned around against Simba, and Scar forces a confession out of him. The lions turn against him and he is caught off guard, he stumbles and falls, and is clinging to the edge of a cliff, with scar standing over him; the same way Scar killed Mufasa. Being the villain, Scar feels the need to explain his dastardly plan, before putting Simba out of his misery. Scar tells Simba that he killed Mufasa. In that moment, for Simba, the world stands still. Before him stands a man, who not only killed his father, but murdered him, and forced Simba, as a child, to deal with the guilt of that loss and that accident. Scar took Simba’s childhood, away from him, separated him from his mother, and the rest of his family. All the pain that had been incubating inside Simba explodes outward in that moment, and he gains the upper hand. He could have killed Scar right then and there, but he knows that this entire mission to save his family was for his father and because of Scar, he will not allow himself to stoop to Scar’s level. In the end, Scar is hoist by his own petard, and eaten by his own underlings the hyenas.</p>
<p>This is the true end of Simba’s initiation. What he brings to society is himself, a good righteous leader. Without scar dying, Simba would have been consumed by guilt his entire life, but when the truth comes out, and justice is served at long last Simba can move on and live his life. He is open to remembering what his father taught him about ruling and being a decent person. Scar’s death allows Simba to lead well, and become a beloved and remembered King.</p>
<p>Simba and Gilgamesh’s stories are similar in many ways. Both initiations begin with death; Simba loses his father and runs away from home and Gilgamesh, after losing his friend Enkidu, leaves Uruk. Both heroes wander in deserts and vast waste lands, looking for something to ease the pain of their loss. Both find their escape. Simba finds a jungle oasis, and Gilgamesh finds the garden of gods and the path over the sea. Both heroes never truly let go of their loss, but, rather, allow it to give them a sense of purpose in their returns. Simba takes his father’s death to spell responsibility and the need to return home and save it from destruction. Gilgamesh returns home to save his city from the horrors he has brought down on the people and becomes a gentler person. Both heroes, in the end become amazingly successful leaders.</p>
