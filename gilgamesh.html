				<h3>Gilgamesh Character Biography</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Gilgamesh is born two thirds god and one third man. He is destined to be king in the city of Uruk. He talks to the gods on a regular basis. He begins his story as a terrible person, and his people cry out for a savior. Enkidu, a man born of the wild makes his way into the city and challenges Gilgamesh. The two fight, Gilgamesh is given a run for his money, but triumphs in the end. The two become fast friends. They venture out into the world to kill Humbaba, guardian of the forest, who the sun god dislikes. The two kill Humbaba together, and gain the resources of the forest for Gilgameshâ€™s city. Because of this, the two become famous and the daughter of a god offers Gilgamesh her hand in marriage. Gilgamesh refuses, citing the terrible things she has done to the lovers she tired of in the past. In a fit of rage she sends the bull of heaven down, killing hundreds of people. Gilgamesh and Enkidu manage to kill it, but the gods are angry and agree that Enkidu must die. This takes many days and leaves Gilgamesh coping with the loss of his friend. Unable to deal with the grief, he refuses to bury the body for many days, and when he does he goes out of the city and wanders in the wilderness. He seeks to become immortal to not have to go through what Enkidu had to go through. He travels across the entire ocean in order to discover that the only way to become immortal, is to be at the right place at the right time, when all the gods are convened immediately after you, yourself just did something amazing. He is given the challenge that if he can stay awake, he can live forever, and he immediately falls asleep. Still he does not give up, and before he makes his journey back home, he discovers a flower that has the property of giving youth to the elderly. He loses the flower before he gets to use it. Sadly he returns to the city, a better man than he had been before, and rules his kingdom with wisdom and smarts, instead of brutality and goes builds his city up to greatness.</p>
