				<h3>Gilgamesh Character Biography</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Gilgamesh is born two thirds god and one third man. He is destined to be king in the city of Uruk. He talks to the gods on a regular basis. He begins his story as a terrible person, and his people cry out for a savior. Enkidu, a man born of the wild makes his way into the city and challenges Gilgamesh. The two fight, Gilgamesh is given a run for his money, but triumphs in the end. The two become fast friends. They venture out into the world to kill Humbaba, guardian of the forest, who the sun god dislikes. The two kill Humbaba together, and gain the resources of the forest for Gilgamesh’s city. Because of this, the two become famous and the daughter of a god offers Gilgamesh her hand in marriage. Gilgamesh refuses, citing the terrible things she has done to the lovers she tired of in the past. In a fit of rage she sends the bull of heaven down, killing hundreds of people. Gilgamesh and Enkidu manage to kill it, but the gods are angry and agree that Enkidu must die. This takes many days and leaves Gilgamesh coping with the loss of his friend. Unable to deal with the grief, he refuses to bury the body for many days, and when he does he goes out of the city and wanders in the wilderness. He seeks to become immortal to not have to go through what Enkidu had to go through. He travels across the entire ocean in order to discover that the only way to become immortal, is to be at the right place at the right time, when all the gods are convened immediately after you, yourself just did something amazing. He is given the challenge that if he can stay awake, he can live forever, and he immediately falls asleep. Still he does not give up, and before he makes his journey back home, he discovers a flower that has the property of giving youth to the elderly. He loses the flower before he gets to use it. Sadly he returns to the city, a better man than he had been before, and rules his kingdom with wisdom and smarts, instead of brutality and goes builds his city up to greatness.</p>

				<h3>The Epic of Gilgamesh Analysis</h3>
				<p>When Gilgamesh returns as to be king once again he is past the grief of losing his friend he is more open to caring about his fellow man. In realizing that he is not in fact destined to be immortal he can actually take his place in society. He had always seen himself as above all others, as almost a God, and rightfully so, as he is 2/3rds God, however one cannot rule well thinking they are above all others. Once Gilgamesh lost his friend he was able to see that he would die, and that impending death humbled him just enough to make him as successful leader.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh’s initiation begins when Enkidu dies. This is his separation. Because of this he is able to learn humility. Gilgamesh wanders in the dessert searching for answers. He is in denial. He refuses to bury the body for many days. He strips himself of his royal garb and travels in the desert. This is Gilgamesh dealing with his grief for his friend. As he finally accepts that his friend has died, he cannot accept that he too shall die, he seeks out every possible option for how he might live forever. He cannot bring himself to believe otherwise. His entire character changes in a very short expanse of time, the time between the discovery of “The Old Men are Young Again”(the life giving flower) and his eventual return home.</p>
<p>It takes a beating to convince Gilgamesh of his destiny. He is a prideful man. The gods tell him from his birth that death is his lot and that he is destined to be a great king but he will not believe them. The death of Enkidu allows him to see himself as he truly is a mortal man. In the moments after the flower is taken from him, he comes to this realization. He takes time for himself and finally comes to terms with all this, and then and only then does he make his return.
With his newly discovered humility he is able to lead nobly and kindly. He no longer oppresses his people because in accepting the vision of death shared with him by Enkidu, he realizes that he is one with his fellow humans. He leads them because he sees himself in them. He stops murdering and raping, because he knows that the people he tormented fear death just as he does, and that every pain a man who is part god feels, they must feel even harder. He understands that he is set apart from the rest, but only as a king, not as a being. This is what lets him rule well, knowing that he and his people are cut from the same cloth.</p>
