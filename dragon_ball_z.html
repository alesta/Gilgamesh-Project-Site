				<h3>Vegeta Character Biography</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Prince Vegeta, heir to the throne of a now extinct race called the Saiyans, was born on a planet called Vegeta, under the rule of a space tyrant called Frieza. The Saiyans are a brute race, born to fight in battle. Due to this, most Saiyans have a tenacious personality, and will fight any chance they get. The Saiyan race is also known for its pride, as most Saiyans value pride over everything else. The prince is no exception to these standards. He is brutal, willing to kill his own partner, who raised him as a child, solely for the fact that he was no longer of use in battle. He will do whatever fits the situation best for him, not caring about any collateral damage that he may cause. He is cunning, as he knows how the tyrant is using him, and when given the opportunity to strike, he stands down, as he knows that he stands no chance against the threatening tyrant.</p>
<p>However, due to one of the few surviving members of the race, Kakarot, who acts as an Earthling, as he was dropped on the head as a baby, the proud prince begins to change. After the tyrant kills Vegeta, on his deathbed, Vegeta tells Kakarot what happened to their home planet. He says in tears how Frieza had destroyed the planet, as he grew in fear of the race. Vegeta had never shown this side of him before, showing how much he has been changing. After he is brought back to life, he becomes the arrogant, ruthless person he used to be. He had a child with a woman on earth out of wedlock, and is shown to care little about the two, not even attempting to save them when put in life-threating danger. They had to be saved by the child’s future self, as he came back to assist in the fight against the current threat. When given the opportunity to destroy a menace that has killed thousands, he denies it, as said menace had not yet unlocked his full potential. He let his pride get the best of him, and the complete being beat Vegeta without a sweat. Later, when Kakarot sacrifices himself to save the Earth, the being comes back, stronger than ever, killing Vegeta’s future son. After that, Vegeta goes on a rampage, focusing all of his power on killing the menace, in order to try and get revenge on him. This fails, and causes the Earth’s only hope, Kakarot’s son, to break his arm. Vegeta swallows his pride and apologizes to the young boy, something he seldom does. After the threat is removed, Vegeta vows to never fight again, as the only reason he would train was to beat Kakarot, who is now dead.</p>
<p>Seven years have passed, and Vegeta has changed to the point where he lives a normal life on Earth, he has controlled his anger, and is living with his presumed wife and son. The group goes to a martial arts tournament, after hearing that Kakarot would be there. The tournament comes to a screeching halt, once a new threat emerges. The group flies to oppose this threat, which they would easily be able to defeat if not for Vegeta. He lets himself be controlled by the main villain, in order to unlock his full power. However, he resists the evil wizard’s control, due to his pride, and is finally able to fight Kakarot, releasing the true evil. Vegeta, realizing the error he made, goes off to fight the released djinn. As a last ditch effort, Vegeta blows himself up, in a futile attempt to defeat the djinn. He says he is sorry to his family, and that he would miss everyone. This is the turning point in Vegeta’s life. After this moment, Vegeta acts like a normal person, and he lives a happy life with his wife, (who has another child).</p>

				<h3>Dragon Ball Z Analysis</h3>
				<p>The story of Vegeta fits well into the three steps of becoming a hero, separation, initiation, and return. He used to be a savage, not caring who or what got in his way. He obeyed the tyrant that ruled over him, doing what he was told, as he had no other choice. This was his life for many years, changing little if at all. Everything changed once he faced off against the tyrant on a distant planet. It had become obvious to Frieza that Vegeta would no longer be of any use to him, and was sure to surpass him in the near future. Thus, Frieza killed Vegeta in cold blood, which began the journey for Vegeta to become a hero. He showed his true emotions for the first time, pouring out his heart to his sworn enemy, and become softer as time went on in the series. This was his separation, thrown away from the world he became so accustomed to, and forced to change his lifestyle to fit that of those on Earth, a hero. Many years would pass before Vegeta would advance to the next part of the cycle.</p>
<p>All hope lost, Vegeta tries a last-ditch effort to sacrifice himself in order to defeat a much more threating foe. This is the initiation, as he has finally learned the value of other’s life, and learned that not everything in life is to accommodate his needs. He knew he would be sent to the underworld (HEFL), since he had killed so many innocents, and done so many evil deeds. However, the benefits outweighed the costs, and Vegeta did what had to be done, showing a true change in the life of the brute, savage warrior. The final part of the cycle follows almost immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>The threat still persisting, the godlike figure controlling where dead beings go, sent Vegeta to Earth to try and defeat the foe. He comes back to fight, knowing if he is ‘killed’ again, there is nowhere for him to go. Vegeta and Kakarot combine forces, and almost defeat the foe. The fight escalates, and due to his good deeds, Vegeta is finally seen as a good person in the eyes of the gods, allowing him to come back to  life. This is Vegeta’s return, as he has brought back the knowledge that what matters most in life is the now, not what happened in the past. His few good deeds far outweighed the many bad deeds he had committed, and afterwards, Vegeta finally learns how to act like a person on Earth, and embraces it.</p>
