This project was created by Matthew Gallagher, Alexander Stangl, and Tova Tencer for Mr. Weems's Honors World Literature I course.

Note to Mr. Weems: Don't try to read the raw text in the html files. It looks incredibly ugly. Download all of the files to the same directory (especially including the .css file). Once this is done, open the file titled "gilgamesh_project_main.html" in the webbrowser of your choosing. As of this moment, I've only tested it on the Nightly build of firefox, but nothing that I did should have necessarily made any of the formating browser-specific.

Regardless, if there IS an apparent issue with formating on your computer, please let me know ASAP.
